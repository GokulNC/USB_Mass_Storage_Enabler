<h3><b>What is this App:</b></h3><br>

This app will NOT mount your Internal Storage (since it\'s located in /data partition inside the ./media/0/ directory and the /data partition is formatted as EXT4).
<br>If you really want to mount your Internal Storage as UMS, it can done using the <a href='http://google.com/search?q=usb+sharer+apk'>USB Sharer app</a> (but it'll be mounted as read-only).<br><br>

<hr><h3><b>How To Use the App:</b></h3><br>

1. To enable Mass Storage, press 'Enable Mass Storage'.
    (Try 2-3 times if it's not working, also try changing app settings)<br><br>
2. Before disconnecting USB, eject from Computer first, then press the 'Disconnect Mass Storage' button.<br><br>
